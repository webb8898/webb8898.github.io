        <h2>Project 1 - This Website</h2>
        <p>
            This personal resume style website was truly the first HTML and CSS project that I've completed. I first used a Model View Contoller
            (MVC), but had problems getting it to run when I put the URL in. So, I deleted it and started from scratch using just HTML and CSS. I tried to
            implement as many design features as I could onto this site. I plan to keep adding/updating this site in the future.

        <h2>Project 2 - Creating a Database</h2>
        <p>
            In my database management class (junior year), myself and three others created a database from scratch base upon a mock business' needs.
            It was to be funtional and able to run varius queriesoutlining important information for the mock managers. We went from a logical design
            all the way into implementation. Our database was developed in SQL Server Management Studio.
